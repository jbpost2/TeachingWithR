Below you'll find the presentation files for the course and the exercises we'll do during the hands on sessions.  

Note: You also have access to the source material at the [github repo](https://github.com/jbpost2/TeachingWithR).  Feel free to use these materials for any educational purpose!

We've also included links to materials to go further learning R at the bottom of the page!

It may help to have just the R code from the slides so you can easily run the code without typing it out.  Below you'll find .R scripts with just the R code from the notes (notice that there is some extra stuff as we often use R code to bring in images and things like that).

Justin teaches the following three courses for [Data Matters](https://datamatters.org/), a week-long series of one and two-day courses aimed at students and professionals in business, research, and government.  The material is open to anyone.

<h4> <a href = "https://jbpost2.github.io/Basics-of-R-for-Data-Science-and-Statistics/" target = "_blank">Basics of R for Data Science and Statistics</a></h4>

This course covers the material in the first set of notes (R Basics, RMarkdown, & the tidyverse) in quite a bit more detail.  All of the source materials are available on the corresponding github site as well.  Feel free to use these materials for any educational purpose!

<h4> <a href = "https://jbpost2.github.io/Improving-R-Programs/" target = "_blank">Improving R Programs</a></h4>

This course introduces common programming techniques that can improve the efficiency of your R programs. These techniques include the use of loops and vectorized functions to avoid repeated sections of code. To really take R programs to the next level, we see how to write custom functions that will help to streamline code.  Feel free to use these materials for any educational purpose!

<h4> <a href = "https://jbpost2.github.io/R-for-Automating-Workflow-Sharing-Work/" target = "_blank">R for Automating Workflow & Sharing Work</a></h4>

The course provides participants an introduction to utilizing R for writing reproducible reports and presentations that easily embed R output, using online repositories and version control software for collaboration, creation of basic websites using R, and the development of interactive dashboards and web applets.

I am in the process of updating this material.  It will be ready by the first week of August (since that is when I have to teach it :).
